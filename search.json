What is estimated by MSE?\n\nEstimation of error variance\nA point estimate of \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) is MSE = 2.2.\nExplanation of the MSE can be given by the sum of squares decomposition:\nThe decomposition of the total variation of variable Yinto two parts in order to test the significance of the regression model: (1) the variation explained by the model and (2) the residual variation.\nThese two parts are compared using the F statistic.\nThe decomposed variation is based on the sum of squared deviations form the mean, or the sum of squares:\n\\(SS_{tot}\\) = total sum of squares = \\(SS_{tot} = \\sum(Y_{i} - \\widehat{Y})^2\\), which describes the total variation of the variable Y.\nThe regression sum of squares, or model sum of squares, is \\(SS_{reg}\\):\n\\(SS_{reg} = \\sum(\\widehat{Y} - \\overline{Y})^2\\) represents the variation of Y, which is explained by the fitted regression model.\nThe residual sum of squared (\\(SS_{E}\\), also known as the error sum of squares), \\(SS_{E} = \\sum(Y_{i} - \\widehat{Y}_{i})^2\\) corresponds to the Y variation not explained by the model.\n\\(SS_{tot} = SS_{reg} + SS_{E}\\)\nThe degrees of freedom corresponding to individual estimated components of Y variation:\n\\(DF_{tot} = n - 1\\) for degrees of freedom corresponding to \\(SS_{tot}\\).\n\\(DF_{reg}\\) = number of estimated parameters - 1 for degrees of freedom corresponding to \\(SS_{reg}\\).\n\\(DF_{reg}\\) is therefore equal to 1 for a simple linear regression model with two estimated parameters.\n\\(DF_{E} = DF_{tot} - DF_{reg}\\) for the residual sum of squares: \\(DF_{E}\\) is therefore equal to \\(n - 2\\) for simple linear regression.\nThe degrees of freedom are additive, as for the sum of squares.\nMean square (MS) values can be obtained by dividing the a sum of squares by its corresponding number of degrees of freedom, e.g., \\(MS_{E} = SS_{E}/DF_{E}\\).\nIf \\(H_{0}\\) is true, i.e., when X and Y are independent, both \\(MS_{reg}\\) and \\(MS_{E}\\) are estimates of the variance of the dependent variable Y.\nIf the values are dependent, \\(MS_{reg}\\) increases and \\(MS_{E}\\) decreases.\nThe ratio \\(F = MS_{reg}/MS_{E}\\) can therefore be used for regression model significance, with assumed F distribution when \\(H_{0}\\) is correct.\nThe sum of squares are also used to calculate the coefficient of determination, \\(R^{2}\\).\n\\[R^{2} = SS_{reg}/SS_{tot} = 1 - SS_{E}/SS_{tot}\\] The \\(R^{2}\\) coefficient estimates the proportion of explained variation out of the total variation."

It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to theme.scss. The webpage will be on the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nThe GitHub Action installs R so you can have R code in your qmd or Rmd files.
